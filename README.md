# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project is part of the **CodSoft Machine Learning Internship**.

🚀 Project Objective is
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

📂 Dataset
Used is publicly available dataset from [Kaggle - Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)

⚙️ Technologies :
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
  
📊 Workflow :
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Categorical Encoding & Feature Engineering
- SMOTE + Undersampling for class imbalance
- Trained Logistic Regression & Random Forest
- Visualized Feature Importances & Precision-Recall Curve
  
✅ Results (Random Forest):
- **Accuracy:** ~100%
- **AUC Score:** 0.98
- **F1-score (fraud):** 0.62
